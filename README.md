Design Document

Introduction
Purpose: This document outlines the design for a Flask-based web application that provides a user-friendly interface for managing and monitoring Airflow workflows.
Target audience: This document is intended for developers, stakeholders, and anyone interested in understanding the design of the application.
System Overview
Architecture: The application will be built using the Flask framework and will interact with the Airflow REST API to manage and monitor DAGs.
Components:
Frontend: A web-based user interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Backend: A Flask application that handles user requests, interacts with the Airflow API, and manages data storage.
Airflow server: The Airflow platform responsible for scheduling and executing workflows.
Functional Requirements
User authentication: Secure login and logout functionality.
Task management:
Create, view, and edit tasks.
Schedule tasks using cron expressions.
Monitor task status and logs.
Workflow management:
Trigger DAG runs manually.
Monitor DAG status and logs.
Configuration management:
Update server configurations through a web interface.
Audit logging: Track user activity and changes to configurations.
User Interface
Dashboard: Display key metrics and visualizations of task and workflow status.
Task creation form: A user-friendly form for creating and scheduling tasks.
Task list: A table displaying all tasks with their details and status.
Configuration page: A form for updating server configurations.
Audit logs page: A table displaying audit logs with user activity and configuration changes.
Technical Design
Framework: Flask
Database: SQLite
API integration: Airflow REST API
Styling: CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap, Bulma)
JavaScript libraries: Chart.js (for visualizations)
Tech Spec

Frontend
Technology: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Framework: Flask templating engine (Jinja2)
Styling: CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap, Bulma)
JavaScript libraries:
Chart.js (for visualizations)
jQuery (for DOM manipulation and AJAX)
Responsiveness: Design the UI to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
Backend
Technology: Python
Framework: Flask
Database: SQLite
ORM: SQLAlchemy
API integration: Airflow REST API using the requests library
Authentication: Flask-Login (or similar)
Scheduling: APScheduler (or similar)
Error handling: Implement robust error handling and logging.
Deployment
Server: Gunicorn (or similar)
Web server: Nginx (or similar)
Environment: Virtual environment
Deployment process: Automated deployment using tools like Docker or Fabric
Testing
Unit tests: Write unit tests for backend functions and API interactions.
Integration tests: Test the integration between the frontend and backend.
End-to-end tests: Test the entire application flow from the user's perspective.
Security
Authentication: Secure user authentication and authorization.
Password hashing: Hash passwords using a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, scrypt).
CSRF protection: Implement Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.
Input validation: Validate user input to prevent security vulnerabilities.
Performance
Caching: Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance.
Database optimization: Optimize database queries and schema for efficiency.
Asynchronous tasks: Use asynchronous tasks for long-running operations.
Monitoring and Logging
Logging: Implement comprehensive logging to track errors and application activity.
Monitoring: Use monitoring tools to track application performance and resource usage.
Additional considerations

Documentation: Provide clear and concise documentation for the application.
Code style: Follow consistent code style guidelines.
Version control: Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate effectively.
